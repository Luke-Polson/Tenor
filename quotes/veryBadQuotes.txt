The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.
Marcus Aurelius
Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.
Marcus Aurelius
It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.
Marcus Aurelius
Choose not to be harmed — and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed — and you haven’t been.
Marcus Aurelius
We are more often frightened than hurt; and we suffer more in imagination than in reality.
Marcus Aurelius
Demand not that events should happen as you wish; but wish them to happen as they do happen, and your life will be serene.
Epictetus
Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.
Marcus Aurelius
